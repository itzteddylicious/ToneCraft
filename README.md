# ToneCraft
ToneCraft is a comprehensive machine learning application designed to transform text tones. By fine-tuning models like BERT for tone classification and T5 for text generation, ToneCraft allows users to adjust and refine text between professional and friendly tones with ease.

## Features
- **Tone Classification**: Classifies input text tone as professional or friendly using a fine-tuned BERT model.
- **Tone Transformation**: Transforms text to the user-specified tone with a T5-based model trained for text generation and stylistic adjustments.
- **User Input Logging**: Records tone selection and usage data to improve future interactions.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Collects user feedback on tone accuracy to continually improve model performance.
- **API Integration**: A scalable API layer to handle text processing requests.
